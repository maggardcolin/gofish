The goal of this app was to create a GoFish-like game that a user plays against a computer. This computer can remember which cards the player asks for that it does not have at the time, and will also remember which cards it has already asked for that the player does not have (to its knowledge). The computer will ask if you have cards in this order: cards that it knows you have that it also has, cards that it has that it hasn't asked you for already, then finally cards that it has that it has already asked for. I created this project in December 2023 and would describe this as a very basic AI project due to the computer player having the ability to make intelligent decisions that aren't entirely based on random chance.

*How it works*
Each player has a hand, as well as a point total that is updated each time a pair is made. The deck/pond and each of these hands use ArrayLists to store the Card objects. There is a method that checks a player's hand for pairs, and with the aforementioned computer logic, it is possible to play a full game against the computer. This game follows what I would consider to be standard rules for GoFish, but individual rules are not difficult to implement and I may consider adding a way to change them, such as the number of cards drawn when your hand is empty, or using 4-of-a-kinds instead of pairs for points.
